##iPod Classic

Let's draw an iPod Classic using HTML/CSS!  Please work with a partner!


###Step 1 (File Structure)

  - Create an `ipod` directory in today's student folder. Put all other files in that directory. You'll need an `index.html` and a `style.css`. Link your `css` page to your `html` page.

###Step 2 (Actually make an iPod!)

Some pointers/pro-tips/resources.

  - Break down the example iPod picture in terms of its visual components.
  - Think about how to lay these components within/on top of each other.
  - [Colours](http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/color.html)
  - [Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#Examples)
  - Make the cursor turn into a pointer when it is hovering over the spin wheel in the center.
  - Customize your iPod's color.

### BONUS

  - Use borders to make it have a more 3-D look/feel.
  - Change the screen content to have an awesome image or video.
