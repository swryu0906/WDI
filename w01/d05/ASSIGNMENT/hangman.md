This weekend you will be creating the popular game of Hangman as a JavaScript console game!

## Letter() 

Letter is a function that returns a Letter object.  

#### Object Properties

* `value`
  * a string
* `hidden`
  * a boolean ( should be set to true by default )
* `hide()`
  * a function that will set `hidden` to true
* `show()`
  * a function that will set `hidden` to false
* `render()`
  * a function that will return ` _ ` if the letter is hidden and return the value if the letter is not hidden

## Word()

Word is a function that will return an object 

#### Object Properties

* `letters`
  * an array of Letter objects
* `getLetters(newWord)`
  * accepts an input argument, a string. It will split the string into `Letter` objects and push them into the `letters` array
* `isFound()`
  * returns true if no letters are still hidden
  * returns false if at least one letter is hidden
* `try(letter)`
  * accepts an input argument, a string goes through letters and reveals the ones whose value mathes the input argument `letter`returns a boolean indicating if the letter was found
* `render()`
  * returns the word in its "guessed state"
  * ex: for the word 'closure', if the letters l, s, and e have been guessed, this function should return the string `_ l _ s _ _ e`

## game

Game is an object literal.

#### Attributes

* `guesses`
  * a number
* `guessedLetters`
  * an array of strings
* `words`
  * an array of strings
* `currentWord` 
  * starts as an empty string
* `startGame(wordsArray)`
  * should accept an argument, an array of strings
  * should set `guesses` to ten
  * should reset the `guessedLetters` array
  * should reset the `words` array
  * should fill the `words` array with the words from `wordsArray` 
  * should select a random word from `words` and create `currentWord` `Word` object, should `getLetters` for the `currentWord
* `guess(letter)`
  * Ask the word to `try(letter)` if `letter` hasn't been tried already. Push the `letter` tried into the array of `guessedLetters`
* `isOver()`
  * Returns true if `currentWord` has been guessed completely or if `guesses` is 0
* `overMessage()`
  * Returns "You win" if `currentWord` is found
  * Returns "You lose" if `guesses` is 0
  * Returns an empty string if game is not over
* `render()`
  * Displays rendered word, and number of guesses left, and the guessed letters so far


## Main Progam

* create an array of words to be used as a bank of words for the game
* start a new game using this array of words
* accept user input (using `prompt()` or `readline-sync`) and make moves in a looping manner, until the game is over
* When the game is over, the game over message should be displayed and the
program should exit.

## Bonus

* After the game is over, give the user the option to either quit or start a new game, and implement the necessary code for this feature to work
