## JavaScript!

![Foo](http://loveforsuccessfulwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Practice.jpg)

Tonight you are going to write JavaScript statements to solve the following problems. This assignment is to get you to started thinking like a developer.

A starter file has been provided and is where you should work tonight.

#### Subjects covered.

  - Data Types, Variables, and Arrays
  - Control Flow
  - Loops

#### 1. The making of a variable.
Create an array that contains four strings.
Each one should be assigned the value that contains a different season.
The array will have 4 indices, 0 through 3. :fallen_leaf:

#### 2. Using conditional statement.
Write the statements that checks to see if a beer buyer is over 21.
We want to sell the booze! However, we can't sell to minors. 
Write an **if/else** statement that prompt to ask someone's age and alert a response depending on input. :beer:

  huh...what is prompt you say?

#### 3. Hello operators.
Take the variables and numbers given to you and replace the blanks with a mathematical or boolean operators that makes the statement console.log true. :wave:

```javascript
  var a = 4;
  var b = 53;
  var c = 57;
  var d = 16;
  var e = 'Kevin';
```

-  a _ b;
-  c _ d;
-  'Name' ___ 'Name';
-  a _ b ___ c;
-  a _ a ___ d;
-  e ___ 'Kevin';
-  48 ___ '48';

#### 4. Pythagorean Theorem.
Given the following variables.
Write the JavaScript statements that can solve for sideC using pythagorean theorem.
So when console.log for sideC you get the correct answer. :triangular_ruler:

```javascript
  var sideA = 3;
  var sideB = 4;
  var sideC;
```
  
  hint: checkout the Math Methods in javascript

#### 5. Switch Statement.
Write a **switch** JavaScript statement that prompt to ask what day is today. :date:

- If it's Monday alert "Week just started!"
- If it's Tuesday alert "So far so good!"
- If it's Wednesday alert "Halfway there!"
- If it's Thursday alert "Almost there!"
- If it's Friday, Saturday or Sunday alert "Woooo, finally end of the week!"
- If it's not anything above alert "Huh, sorry didn't get that?"

#### 6. Do the D.A.N.C.E 1 2 3 4 5.
Write a loops that alerts multiple times in this order. :headphones:

- Do the 
- D
- A
- N
- C
- E
- 1
- 2
- 3
- 4
- 5
- Stick to the
- B
- E
- A
- T
- Get ready to ignite

hint: create an **something**, then use a **something** to iterate over it. 

#### 7. Let's take the Subway.
Write out the JavaScript that would do the following. :station:

- When the script is run a menu should be prompted displaying:
  - A list of three trains - `The (L) Train, The (N) Train, The (S)ix Train`
  - The prompt ask the user to make their selection

    - If the user enters: `L`
      - An alert should output a message containing the user's selection labeled as L train
      - A console log output should contain the following:
        - `8th Ave`
        - `6th Ave`
        - `Union Square`
        - `3rd Ave`
        - `1st Ave`
        - `Bedford Ave`
    - If the user enters: `N`
      - An alert should output a message containing the user's selection labeled as N train
      - A console log output should contain the following:
        - `Times Square`
        - `Herald Square`
        - `28th St`
        - `23rd St - DAPS Nexus`
        - `Union Square`
        - `8th St `
    - If the user enters `S`
      - An alert should output a message containing the user's selection labeled as S train
      - A console log output should contain the following:
        - `Grand Central`
        - `33rd St`
        - `28th St`
        - `23rd St`
        - `Union Square`
        - `Astor Place`

- Then a thank You message should alert.
- The program then exits.

Bonus:
- Rather than exit after the program is run, let's allow the users to use our program until they choose to quit. 
  - This quit option should be accessible when users can choose a train line.
  - When the user quits, the program should alert the user then the program has ended.  

#### Extra Bonus:
#### 8. Array all day.
Find the median number in the following array, then console.log that number. :clipboard:

```javascript
  var nums = [14,11,16,15,13,16,15,17,19,11,12,14,19,11,15,17,11,18,12,17,12,71,18,15,12];
```
  hint: Using some kind of method to put in order first, then use some kind of Math method to find the median.

#### Finished? :trophy:

Awesome! Please submit your evening assignment via a GitHub issue. In the body of your submission, make sure to leave your comfortability (0–5), completeness (0–5), a win, a challenge and maybe a comment about this assignment.
