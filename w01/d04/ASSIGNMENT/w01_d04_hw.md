#### Subjects covered.

  - Objects

Hello and welcome to wonderful world of object nesting.

#####GET THROUGH PART 3 **AND** FINISH AT LEAST THE *LINE* section of PART 4!! 

As always, the more you finish the better, but stay healthy and get the rest you need.


For each part, copy and paste each code snippet into your browser's javascript console, and use your knowledge of javascript to complete the tasks below! You can and will be testing your answers in the console.
As you continue to the next parts, make sure to copy and paste the code snippets into the same javascript console you were working in, as the exercises will build upon each other.

Create a `homework` folder in today's directory, and touch an `app.js` file within it.

Today we visit Jurassic Park! You have been brought on to manage the dig sites for Dr. John Hammond. No expense has been spared, so let's get to work!

## Part 1

```javascript
snakewaterMontana = {
  paleontologist: "Dr. Alan Grant",
  depth: "10 meters",
  specimen: "Velociraptor"
}
```

  1. Create a variable called `guestOfHonor` and assign it's value to the name of the paleontologist at Snakewater, Montana.

  2. Access the value of the specimen found in Snakewater, Montana, and store it in a variable called `cleverGirl`.

## Part 2


```javascript

  nicaragua = {
    depth: "200 meters",
    annualbudget: 1500000,
    specimens: [
      "Tyrannosaurus Rex",
      "Stegosaurous",
      "Triceratops",
      "Velociraptor"
    ]
  }

```

  1. Store the array of specimens of this site into a variable called `nicaraguanSpecimens`.

  2. Make a variable called `favoriteSpecimen` and assign its value to your favorite dinosaur within nicaraguanSpecimens ( can you do this by referencing the nicaragua object itself? )

  3. Add 250000 to the annual budget of this site.

## Part 3

```javascript
hammondsMines = {
  buenosaires: {
    depth: "400 meters",
    annualbudget: 1000000,
    specimens: [
      "Dilophosaurus",
      "Brachiosaurus"
    ]
  },
  mexico: {
    depth: "350 meters",
    annualbudget: 900000,
    specimens: [
      "Gallimimus",
      "Parasaurolophus"
    ]
  }
}
```

  1. Access the depth of John Hammond's mine in Mexico, store the depth of the Mexican mine into an appropriately named variable.

  2. Access and the annual budget for Hammond's mine in Buenos Airies, store the annual budget for Hammond's mine in Buenos Aires.

  3. Access and console log the dinosaur DNA specimens found in Buenos Aires.

  4. Insert Nicaragua into `hammondsMines`

  5. Create three variables to store the annual budgets for each mine into them.

  6. Create a new reasonably named variable to track the total annual cost of operation for the mines by adding the previously stored budgets.

  7. Access and console log the "Parasaurolophus" specimen.

# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

##### Learning Objectives
- Practice modeling a problem domain in an object-oriented way
- Practice defining classes with attributes and behaviors

## Part 4

# MTA Rail - OOP, I Did It Again

It's time. MTA Rail App is almost ready. We need to make just a few more changes to
get it ready to be deployed. We are going to refactor our program to utilize an
object-oriented approach.

We are going to utilize two classes to model this problem.

* Line - represents a subway line, that will contain a bunch of stations
* Subway - represents a subway system that contains a bunch of lines


## Line

- Line should be an Object Constructor Function that should accept 2 arguments. The first one should be a string which will be the name of the Line. The second argument should be an array of stations which will be the line's stations.

**Attributes/Properties**

* `name` - string, name of the line
* `stations` - an array of stations which were passed in as an argument

**Behaviors/Functions**

1. `showStations()`
  - Return a string containing the station names
  - ex. `"42nd St, 34th St, Union Square, Brooklyn"`
2. `addStation(stationName)`
  - Accepts a single argument, a string, `stationName`
  - Creates a station object with the argument and pushes the station object into the line's stations
3. `whereIs(stationName)`
  - Accepts a single argument, a string, `stationName`
  - Returns a number, the index of the specified `station_name` in `@stations`
  - Returns `false` if the station is not found
4. `calcTrip(start, stop)`
  - Accepts two arguments, string, `start` and `stop`, which represent
    the names of two stations
  - Returns the number of stops required to travel from `start` to `stop`
  - Returns `false` if either of the stops is incorrect
  - HINT : we wrote a function that gives us the position of the station on the current line. we called it calcTrip ;)

## Subway

  - Subway should be an Object Constructor Function that takes no arguments

**Attributes/Properties**

* `lines` - Should start as an empty object, but will be an object where keys are the name of the line, and values are `Line` objects after utilizing the addLine() function

**Behaviors/Functions**

1. `showLines()`
  - Returns a string of the available lines (the keys of the subway's lines property)
2. `showStations(lineName)`
  - Accepts a single argument, string, `lineName`
  - Returns a string containing the name of the line, and the stations on the line
  - ex. `"Q line: 42nd St, 34th St, Union Square, Canal St"`
3. `addLine(lineName, stations)`
  - Accepts two arguments - `lineName` is a string, name of the new line, `stations` is an array of strings
  - Creates a new Line object using lineName and stations  
  - Adds the new line just creates to the property `lines`
4. `calcTrip(lineName, start, stop)`
  * Accepts three arguments, all strings
    * `lineName` - name of the line on which you wish to travel
    * `start` - name of station where you want to start
    * `stop` - name of station where you want to stop
  * Returns a number indicating how many stations from start to stop
    * If any of the input arguments are incorrect, your method should return false

## The Main Program

##### Before we start we're gonna wanna create the objects we will be working with. First, start by creating a subway object. Once we have a subway object we can use it's `addLine` function to add lines to it. EX. `subway.addLine('Q', ['canal st', 'union sq', 'times sq'])`. Once you have created a subway with atleast 3 lines, proceed to create your main program loop


Same specs as before. Users should be able to:

- View available lines
- Choose a line and see its stations
- Add a line
- Calculate the distance between two stops on a train line
- Quit

#### Finished? :trophy:

Awesome! Please submit your evening assignment via a GitHub issue with **your name in the title**. In the body of your submission, provide a link to today's afternoon lab, **a link to the homework**, and make sure to leave your comfortability (0–10), completeness (0–4), a win, a challenge and maybe a comment about this assignment.
