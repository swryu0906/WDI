# Is True Grit the Most Important to Success?

After watching TED Talk about Grit, I seriously thought about what is the most important factor for success. While there are a number of factors that determine success, grit may be among the most important, according to Angela Lee Duckworth. I completely agree with most of her claim such as


> “Grit is the tendency to sustain interest in and effort toward very long-term goals. It equips individuals to pursue especially challenging aims over years and even decades.”

Grit is a good thing, especially for the people who need a lot of challenge spirit with great persistence like entrepreneurs. As we all well know, launching and growing a successful enterprise isn't a simple task. Business owners need to steadfastly focus and persist as they pursue their goals, and being gritty must be needed.

However, she may ignore the dark side of grit. In same cases, grit may result either unremitting failure or really costly success to some people.

Any way, Duckworth’s belief gave me an opportunity to take time for self-examination. While looking back my past, I was able to reflect on my past conducts without grit.
